              I’m human!
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been around the sun a few times or so!  Married with four grown boys!  Grandmother of one little boy!  Life has had its ups and downs for sure – I have survived and thrived!
            </p>
            <p>
              I began my career in the Direct Sales Industry as a bit of fluke!  I was already working as an Executive Assistant to a CEO and was paid pretty well but something kept urging me 
              that I could do more, that I could impact more people if only I would step outside my comfort zone.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I had done Direct Sales as an independent “Sales Agent” for a few companies – some start-ups and others pretty established and had some success but on a whim I sent in a resume to AVON – I mean that was a big and successful company and just maybe they would hire me – and they did!  And I LOVED IT!  
            </p>
            <p>From that early beginning I went on to work for several Party Plan companies and Multi Level Marketing companies.  Some were wonderful experiences!  And some were not!

            </p>
            <p>
              BUT, I bet I have talked to thousands of independent “Sales Agents” and Leaders, and have walked alongside their journeys as a coach, trainer and/or mentor.
            </p>
            <p>
              That brings me to today! I have been there, done that and now I want to help you!
