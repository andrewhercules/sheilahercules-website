          <p>
            Here are a few examples of recent client projects that I completed over the last six months.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Company A, a mid-size direct sales company in the health and personal care sector</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The company reached out to me as they wanted to focus on two key areas:
            <ol>
              <li>Overhauling their New Consultant onboarding to increase consultant participation and engagement within the first 30 days.</li>
              <li>Encouraging the development and retention of mid- to senior-level field Leaders</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            To help this company achieve its goals, I focused on four key areas:
            <ul>
              <li>Conducted a comprehensive review of the Consultant Starter Kit and made a series of recommendations to contents of product and paperwork</li>
              <li>Reviewed and edited all existing paperwork and forms for new Consultants to align with broader strategies to strengthen the onboarding experience</li>
              <li>Created a new email campaign to encourage quick actions and next steps to quickly familiarize new Consultants with business opportunity and support their initial engagement</li>
              <li>Audited all existing training documents and developed a new layout and consultant journey for Online Training Center that offered a more focused and on-demand training experience</li>
            </ul> 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Company B, a mid-size direct sales company in the clothing and accessories sector</b>
          </p>
            After a period of substantial growth, this company wanted to:
            <ol>
              <li>Increase engagement with their Conulstants using their preferred platform (Facebook) </li>
              <li>Provide timely recognition to support Leadership Development</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with their senior leadership team and founder, I helped the team:
            <ul>
              <li>Create and execute recognition posts and messages to Field</li>
              <li>Outlined strategy for internal staff to continue Recognition work</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's connect and see how I can help you and your organisation engage with the field!
